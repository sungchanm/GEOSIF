# GEOSIF

GEOSIF: A continental-scale sub-daily reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence derived from OCO-3 and GK-2A over Eastern Asia and Oceania.


GEOSIF.py is a Python script for model training and SHAP analysis.

This study used BRDF-normalized GK-2A Blue, Green, Red, and NIR reflectance. Please consider the different processing levels of reflectance datasets to apply our approach to other GEO satellites (e.g. Himawari or GOES).
